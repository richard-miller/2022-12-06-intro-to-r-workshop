download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")


# Read some data from a CSV file

# Load up the required "dplyr" library from the TidyVerse


#
# Some common dplyr functions - select(), filter(), mutate(), group_by(), summarize()
#

#
# select() - subset of columns (variables)
#

# include particular columns: eg plot_id, species_id and weight

# exclude particular columns, eg record_id and species_id using a '-'



#
# filter() - subset of rows (observations)
#

# all rows where year is 1995

# oldest year obversation rows (hint max(year, ))

# longest hindfoot_length



#
# Pipes - plumbing thing together to create pipelines
#

# using temp dataframes, get rows where weight greater then 5 and show only species_id, sex and weight


# and we can store/assign the final result to an object




#
# CHALLENGE 1
#

# Using pipes, subset 'surveys' dataframe to extract animals collected before 1995 and 
# retain only the columns called year, sex, and weight.





#
# mutate() - add columns to a dataframe
#

# lets add a column called weight_kg by dividing the weight by 1000


# we can also add multiple columns at the same time - ie, we cloud also add weight_lb by multiplying by 2.2


# using head() can be useful now


# NA means "not available". We check is a data value is NA with the function is.na() and ! means 'not'


#
# CHALLENGE 2
#

# Create a new data frame from the surveys dataframe that meets the following criteria:
#
# contains only the species_id column and a new column called hindfoot_cm containing 
# the hindfoot_length  values in millimeters converted to centimeters.
#
# The hindfoot_cm column, should have no NA's and all values need to be less than 3.
#
# Hint: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!



#
# group_by() - collect like things together to allow us to summarise them
#
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))

# we can include multiple group_by variables, eg species_id


#
# count() - how many observerations for each (or combinations of) variables(s)
#

# count how many observations of each year

# equivalent to a group_by() and then using the n() function as a summary

# and it also has a sort = TRUE option

# or we could use the arrange() instead


#
# CHALLENGE 3
#

# 1. How many animals were caught in each plot_type surveyed? 


# 2. Use group_by() and summarize() to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length 
#    for each species (using species_id). 
#
#    Also include the number of observations for each group (hint: see ?n )


# 3. What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? 
#    Return the columns ```year```, ```genus```, ```species_id```, and ```weight```.

# Reshaping Dataframes - wide vs tall and pivoting between them
#

# A "Wide" dataframe
#
#
#     day   tesla  ford   kia mazda    <---- Names
#     -----------------------------
#     sat       2     1     3     6    <---- Values
#     sun      63    71    95    12    <---- Values
#          
#

cars_wide <- data.frame (
  day   = c("sat", "sun"),
  tesla = c(2, 63),
  ford  = c(1,71),
  kia   = c(3, 95),
  mazda = c(6,12)
) 
  

# Same information represented in a "Long" dataframe
#
#          Key   Value
#
#     day  make  qty
#    +----+-----+----+
#
#
#
#

# tidyr's pivot_longer() can do this for us

# and the reverse 


# now we can apply to our surveys data
surveys_long <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(plot_id, genus) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))

# and reshape wider


#
# CHALLENGE 4 
#

# 1. Spread the surveys data frame with year as columns, plot_id as rows, 
#    and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before reshaping, 
#    and use the function n_distinct() to get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. 
#    It’s a powerful function! See ?n_distinct for more.


# 2. Now take that data frame and pivot_longer() it again, so each row is a unique plot_id by year combination.


# 3. The surveys data set has two measurement columns: hindfoot_length and weight. 
#    This makes it difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of each 
#    measurement per year in different plot types. Let’s walk through a common solution for this type of problem. 
#    First, use pivot_longer() to create a dataset where we have a key column called measurement and a value column that 
#    takes on the value of either hindfoot_length or weight. 
#    Hint: You’ll need to specify which columns are being pivoted.


# 4. With this new data set, calculate the average of each measurement in each year for each different plot_type. 
#    Then pivot_wider() them into a data set with a column for hindfoot_length and weight. 
#    Hint: You only need to specify the key and value columns for pivot_wider().




#
# Exporting data
#

# lets use write_csv() to save data in our data_out folder
